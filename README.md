# Snowflake Real-Time Sales Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
- Built a **real-time sales analytics pipeline** using Snowflake.  
- Simulated **e-commerce sales data** in python and ingested it continuously.  
- Modeled data in a **star schema** for analytics.  
- Visualized insights on **interactive dashboards**.  

## 🎯 Objectives
- Ingest real-time sales data using:
  - Internal Stages  
  - Snowpipe  
  - Streams  
- Apply **star schema design** for analytical queries.
- Optimize performance with:
  - Clustering  
  - Materialized Views  
- Build **dashboards for business insights** in PowerBI.  

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Snowflake** (Free Trial)  
- **Python (Colab)** + Snowflake Connector (for synthetic data generation)  
- **Snowflake Internal Stage**  
- **PowerBI Desktop** (dashboards)  
- **💰 Total Cost**: $0 (all free tools/tiers)  

## 🏢 Business Context
- Simulated an **e-commerce company** needing real-time insights.  
- Benefits of real-time vs batch reporting:  
  - View **sales per minute** during peak hours.  
  - Identify **top-selling products** for inventory planning.  
  - Track **revenue trends across regions**.  
  - Monitor **KPIs** for fast decision-making.  

## 🚀 Setup & Execution
- Create **Snowflake resources**:
  - Warehouse, Database, Schema, Tables, Internal Stage  
- Enable real-time ingestion with:  
  - **Snowpipe**  
  - **Streams**  
- Generate synthetic data in **Python (Colab)** → Ingest into Snowflake.  
- Model data into **Fact & Dimension tables** (Star Schema).  
- Optimize with **Clustering Keys** + **Materialized Views**.  
- Build dashboards in **PowerBI desktop (connected to Snowflake)**.  

## 🔐 Security
- Implemented **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.  
- Restricted **internal stage access** to authorized roles.  

## 📊 Sample Insights
- Identified **peak sales patterns** during a time-frame.  
- Highlighted **top 5 products** driving most revenue.  
- Highlighted **top 5 categories** driving most revenue.  
- Analyzed **regional sales growth trends**.  

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- **Real-time analytics** achievable with **Snowflake Internal Stages**.  
- **Python + Snowflake Connector** enables smooth ingestion.  
- **Snowpipe + Streams** make continuous ingestion seamless.  
- **PowerBI** delivers free, interactive dashboards.
